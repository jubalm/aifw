# Key Decisions

## Technology Choices

### Frontend Framework
**Choice**: [e.g., React, Vue, Next.js]
**Why**: [e.g., Team familiar with React, large ecosystem, good TypeScript support]
**Alternatives Considered**: [e.g., Vue (smaller bundle), Angular (too complex for team size)]

### Programming Language
**Choice**: [e.g., TypeScript, JavaScript]
**Why**: [e.g., Catch errors at compile time, better IDE support, team prefers type safety]
**Trade-offs**: [e.g., Slightly slower development initially, build step required]

### Styling Solution
**Choice**: [e.g., Tailwind CSS, styled-components, CSS modules]
**Why**: [e.g., Faster prototyping, consistent design system, no CSS naming conflicts]
**Alternatives Considered**: [e.g., Plain CSS (too much boilerplate), Emotion (similar to styled-components)]

### State Management
**Choice**: [e.g., Zustand, Redux, React Query]
**Why**: [e.g., Simple API, good TypeScript support, lightweight compared to Redux]
**When We Use It**: [e.g., Global app state, user preferences, not for server data]

### Database
**Choice**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite]
**Why**: [e.g., Relational data fits our use case, team experience, good performance]
**Trade-offs**: [e.g., More setup than SQLite, less flexible than MongoDB]

## Architecture Decisions

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: [e.g., Error boundaries + toast notifications, centralized error logging]
**Why**: [e.g., Better user experience, easier debugging, consistent error handling]
**Impact**: [e.g., Reduced support requests, faster bug resolution]

### API Design
**Decision**: [e.g., REST API, GraphQL, tRPC]
**Why**: [e.g., Team familiar with REST, simpler caching, good tooling]
**Constraints**: [e.g., Mobile app needs specific endpoints, third-party integrations]

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: [e.g., NextAuth, Firebase Auth, custom JWT]
**Why**: [e.g., Supports multiple providers, good security defaults, active maintenance]
**Security Considerations**: [e.g., HTTPS required, secure cookie settings, CSRF protection]

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: [e.g., Vercel, AWS, Docker containers]
**Why**: [e.g., Simple deployment, good Next.js integration, reasonable pricing]
**Trade-offs**: [e.g., Vendor lock-in vs self-hosted flexibility]

## Development Workflow Decisions

### Version Control
**Decision**: [e.g., Git with feature branches, trunk-based development]
**Why**: [e.g., Allows parallel development, code review process, rollback safety]
**Branch Strategy**: [e.g., main + feature branches, squash merge]

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: [e.g., Unit tests + Integration tests, minimal E2E]
**Why**: [e.g., Faster feedback loop, easier to maintain, good cost/benefit ratio]
**Philosophy**: [e.g., Test behavior not implementation, focus on user-facing functionality]

### Code Quality Tools
**Decision**: [e.g., ESLint + Prettier + Husky, SonarCloud for analysis]
**Why**: [e.g., Prevent bugs before production, consistent team code style, automated enforcement]
**Philosophy**: [e.g., Fail fast, automate what can be automated, focus reviews on logic]

## Business Constraints That Influenced Decisions

### Budget Constraints
- [e.g., Chose Vercel over AWS to reduce DevOps overhead]
- [e.g., Using free tiers where possible in early stages]

### Timeline Constraints  
- [e.g., Chose familiar technologies to move faster]
- [e.g., Skipped advanced features for MVP launch]

### Team Constraints
- [e.g., Single developer, so chose simple architecture]
- [e.g., Junior team, so avoided complex patterns]

### Legal/Compliance Requirements
- [e.g., GDPR compliance required EU data residency]
- [e.g., Healthcare data requires HIPAA compliance]

## Lessons Learned & Trade-offs

### What Worked Well
- [e.g., TypeScript caught many bugs early]
- [e.g., Tailwind sped up styling significantly]
- [e.g., Feature-based folders improved code organization]

### What We'd Do Differently
- [e.g., Should have added testing earlier in development]
- [e.g., Database schema could have been better planned]
- [e.g., API design needed more upfront planning]

### Current Pain Points
- [e.g., Bundle size growing too large]
- [e.g., Database queries getting complex]
- [e.g., Manual deployment process error-prone]

## Future Considerations
- [e.g., May need to add caching layer as users grow]
- [e.g., Considering microservices if team grows]
- [e.g., Mobile app may require API changes]
